# Configuration

Swarmpits behavior can be reconfigured via Environment Variables.

## `SWARMPIT_BASE_URL`
In scenarios when you are running swarmpit behind reverse-proxy under path segment, 
you can change base URL to desired segment. Segment hast to start and end with `/` (eg. `/swarmpit/`). 
Default is `/`.
